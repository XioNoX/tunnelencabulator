# tunnelencabulator
For a number of years now, work has been proceeding in order to bring to perfection the crudely-conceived idea of a machine that would not only supply the easy re-routing of traffic for load-balanced services, but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing directional LibreNMSes and icingas.  Such an instrument is the tunnel-encabulator.
