# tunnelencabulator
For a number of years now, work has been proceeding in order to bring to perfection the crudely-conceived idea of a machine that would not only supply the easy re-routing of traffic for load-balanced services, but would also be capable of automatically synchronizing single-homed LibreNMSes and icingas.  Such an instrument is the [tunnel-encabulator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ac7G7xOG2Ag).

Now, basically, the only new principle involved is that instead of hostnames
being resolved by the relative motion of recursive and authoritative servers,
they are resolved instead by the modial interaction of gethostbyname and /etc/hosts.

The tunnelencabulator has now reached a high level of development, and is being used
successfully in the operation of wikitrunnions.  Moreover, whenever a forescent skor
motion is required towards non-multihomed services, it may also be employed in conjunction
with a loopback interface reciprocation dingle arm.

```
usage: tunnelencabulator.py [-h] [-s] [-d DATACENTER] [-u] [-f] [--ssh-args SSH_ARGS]
                            [--version]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s, --ssh-tunnel      Whenever a forescent skor motion towards gerrit is required,
                        --ssh-tunnel may also be engaged, effectively preventing side
                        fumbling of LibreNMSes and icinga and other such non-CDN-served
                        marzlevanes, by employing the special mechanism of a port
                        forwarding dingle arm.
  -d DATACENTER, --datacenter DATACENTER
                        Specify a particular target datacenter. If not specified,
                        defaults to one that is not your normal lotus-o-delta GeoDNS
                        site.
  -u, --undo            Undo any prior inverse reactive current applied to /etc/hosts
                        and exit.
  -f, --no-foreground   Instead of staying in the foreground, return control to the
                        ambifacient lunar waneshaft after connecting.
  --ssh-args SSH_ARGS   Extra arguments to pass to the ssh girdle spring
  --version             show program's version number and exit
```
